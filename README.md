# Bank-Churn
<b>Introduction and Background:</b>
<br></br>
The purpose of this project is to compare the performance of Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM in predicting whether a customer will leave a bank or not. The methods were selected because they are the most popular classification methods out there. Because banks generally make money by using customer savings, having customers leave is detrimental to their business. By creating a model that can predict who is to leave, banks can design business initiatives to cater to those customers and better retain them.
